# Biometric_Identification

A set of projects in the field of biometric identification

1)Project 2 - A simple implementation of Naive Bayes and K means, comparing the two classifiers using the MNIST dataset

2)Minutiae Matching - Simple matlab implemtnation of hough algorithm based minutiae matching

3)Fisher_faces_faceRecognition - face recognition using fisher faces technique

4)Face Recognition usign LBP and SSR; LBP - Linear Binary patternn is a type of feature vector ; SSR - Single Scale Retinex is an retinex algorithm to normalize the images for illumination variance(removes the shaddows under the nose and eyes) More can be found in the report added in the folder. This implementation also includes an implementation(not the best one) which runs in realtime.
